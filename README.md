# Topic - Head Start Accessibility across the Continental U.S.
Established in 1965, Head Start promotes school readiness for children in low-income families by offering educational, nutritional, health, social, and other services. Since its inception, Head Start has served more than 38 million children birth to age 5 and their families. In 2020, Head Start was funded to serve 839,116 children and pregnant people in centers, family homes, and in family child care homes. The program is rooted in urban, suburban, and rural communities throughout the nation.

To better facitilate the course of Head Start, we analyzed public data to estimate the accessibility of Head Start program in the continental United States. We constructed multiple metrics in order to accurately measure and compare the accessibility of Head Start across the states and counties. The regional areas where communities in need of Head Start might be underserved are identified by our metrics. Our analysis will help policy makers and federal agents to make Head Start available to every family in need of it.

# Technologies In-use
Python: for data extraction, data analysis, and statistical modelling.

Tableau: for data visualization.

PowerPoint: for presentation of insights.

# Major Findings
We found that there are a clusters of counties in both Texas and Georgia where the metric children per center have abnormaly high values, indicating potential scarcity of Head Start recourse in those areas. Policy makers may need to find more Head Start participants in those areas so as to facilitate the accessibility of Head Start.

Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas are the states with the lowest estimated enrollment rate, meaning that the communities in these five states are very likely to be underserved. Policy makers may need to increase the public exposure of Head Start, especially to the low income families, so that the low income families are aware of Head Start and begin enrolling Head Start.

A linear regression model was built to better understand and evaluate the funding policy of Head Start. The model suggests strong correlation between funding amount, enrollment amount, and regional personal income level. 

# Major Achievements
To accurately measure the impact and current situation of Head Start, we constrcuted multiple useful metrics to support our argument. The metrics that we have constructed and used include:
- Children per Center
- Fund per Child
- Funding Index
- Enrollment Rate
- Center Coverage Rate

Each of the metrics are intended to solve one or a group of closely related questions. And they performed well both measuring the program impact and identifying potential inequality.
