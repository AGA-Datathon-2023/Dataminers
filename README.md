# Topic - Head Start Accessibility across the Continental U.S.
Established in 1965, Head Start promotes school readiness for children in low-income families by offering educational, nutritional, health, social, and other services. Since its inception, Head Start has served more than 38 million children birth to age 5 and their families. In 2020, Head Start was funded to serve 839,116 children and pregnant people in centers, family homes, and in family child care homes. The program is rooted in urban, suburban, and rural communities throughout the nation.

To better facitilate the course of Head Start, we analyzed public data to estimate the accessibility of Head Start program in the continental United States. We constructed multiple metrics in order to accurately measure and compare the accessibility of Head Start across the states and counties. The regional areas where communities in need of Head Start might be underserved are identified by our metrics. Our analysis will help policy makers and federal agents to make Head Start available to every family in need of it.
